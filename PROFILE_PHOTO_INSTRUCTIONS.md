# Adding Your Profile Photo to the Portfolio

To add your profile photo to the portfolio:

1. Locate your desired profile photo on your computer
2. Rename it to `mak_profile.jpg` 
3. Copy the file to the following location in your project:
   ```
   c:\Users\mkhnz\OneDrive\Desktop\mak-portfolio\public\images\mak_profile.jpg
   ```
4. Refresh your browser to see the changes

## Alternative Method (If Using the Upload Feature)

1. Start the development server with `npm start`
2. Open the portfolio in your browser
3. Click the "Change Photo" button on your profile image
4. Select your photo from your computer
5. Click "Upload Photo"
6. The change will be temporary and reset when you refresh the page (this is because we don't have a backend server to permanently store the uploaded image)

Note: In a production environment, you would typically have a backend server to handle file uploads and storage.
